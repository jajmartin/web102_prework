## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The biggest challenge for me was implementing the addGamesToPage function, specifically figuring out how to use the innerHTML method. Once I understood you can simply enter a templated string with various html tags, it became easier to implement. Additionally, it took me some time to realize that I need to use the appendChild method when adding new elements to various containers. Overall, building the app was fun and not too challenging.
